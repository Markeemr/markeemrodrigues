									<h1>New Orleans<br />
										Spring Break 2020</h1>
									<p>Went to NOLA for spring break. Saw some dope things, met even more dope people.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="blogimages/pic10.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>So I went to N'awlins this past spring break and it was one of the most spontaneous and fun things I did. From buying a ticket a day before leaving, to flying by myself, to being around a group of people I really did not know that well, there were definitely a lot of nerves and a lot of things that could have gone wrong. Thankfully everything went well and I saw so many dope things and got closer to some doper people.
								</p>
								<p>I feel like one of the biggest reasons why people go to N'awlins is for the food and when I tell you that food lived up to its hype!! That food was so bomb! I definitely ate a lot of seafood because I’m N'awlins but I was with a couple of people that don't eat seafood and things they got were equally as fire. I got to try pretty much all the traditional food and by far my favorite was the gumbo. Food over there is easily 10/10.
								</p>
								<p>From French Quarter, to Bourbon St., to outside of N'awlins. Everywhere you go has its own vibe to it and feels like you’re in another place. Bourbon St is always packed from morning to late at night. French Quarter is typically busy until midday, I enjoyed walking around it at night when no one was around. My favorite place I went to was definitely StudioBE which is an art gallery by Brandan "Bmike" Odums who is a visual artist from NOLA. If y’all ever get to go to NOLA go check his place out. His art is so unique and so fire that it left so inspired when I left (pics under NOLA gallery). I even got to talk to him about his creative process!
								</p>
								<p>I will definitely be back to N'awlins. I had no complaints and I would continue to develop dope relationships with the local creatives there. If you ever get to visit you will not regret it
